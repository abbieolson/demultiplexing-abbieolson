# demultiplexing-abbieolson

This is the program I wrote with a combination of Python 3 and Bash for demultiplexing multiplexed sequences. 
For brevity, this is the step in which barcodes are used to identify which
sequences come from which samples.

See https://astrobiomike.github.io/amplicon/demultiplexing for a more robust explanation.
